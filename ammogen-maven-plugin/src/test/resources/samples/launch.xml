 <usage name="general">
   <description>
Bring up the contact list which shows all contacts (or some filtered subset such as phonable).
Select the contact with whom you wish to communicate. 
There are two choices for selecting communication target.
One way is to show only the (actionable) available actions.
These are those actions for which the mime data is sufficient to allow the action.
The second way presents the mime data.
In this second mode either the mime data is present for an action, making the action doable, or
the mime data is insufficient and must be provided by the operator.

When an action is loaded it generates an intent which is picked up by a receiver which
updates the action table with the requisite mime types.
